                            <h4>HUFFMAN ALGORITHM (FROM SCRATCH)</h4>
                            <p>This commission-based C++ project tackles Huffman coding for compression and decompression. 
                                In compression, it efficiently encodes text files, storing binary data and a frequency table. 
                                The decompression module reads Huffman-encoded files, reconstructs the Huffman tree, and decodes binary data to restore the original text. 
                                What sets this project apart is its creation from scratch, using only the iostream and fstream libraries. It integrates priority queues 
                                and custom string functions for efficiency, providing a comprehensive Huffman coding solution.</p>

                            <p>A school organization website I personally crafted. This digital space is where you'll soon access real-time updates 
                                on everything Nexus – events, achievements, and the vibrant stories around campus. I've designed a slick, user-friendly interface 
                                for an engaging experience. Whether you're a student, faculty, or just curious about Nexus life, this website will be the go-to for features, 
                                interviews, and the pulse of our school. It hasn't been published yet due to various reasons.</p>

                            <p>This is a website I designed for a coffee shop. It's a digital space where coffee lovers can explore specific menus, savoring the diverse offerings of the café. 
                                 With features like easy navigation and a touch of interactivity, the site aims to provide a delightful online experience for coffee lovers.</p>

                            <p>This GUI-based Bookshop Management System is a personal project born out of curiosity and my exploration of Java GUI. 
                                Designed to provide an intuitive interface for efficient book management, the system enables users to organize and track their
                                 book collection seamlessly. Making use of Java Swing for the user interface and relying on JDBC, MySQL, and XAMPP for the backend, 
                                 it ensures smooth interaction with a MySQL database, enhancing the overall functionality of book management</p>

                            <p>I developed this e-commerce website as a thesis project for a fellow students, with a focus on clothing, footwear, and more. 
                                Tailored as a commission-based initiative, the goal is to provide our client with a seamless online shopping experience. From chic clothing options to trendy footwear, 
                                the platform is crafted to exhibit a diverse range of products. 
                                Notably, it's intentionally designed as front-end only due to budget constraints, allowing the clients to independently manage back-end development.</p>
